# imageService

This project was initialized with boilerplate ExpressJs code. My work is mostly located in the index.js file.
Of all the languages I know (Groovy, Python, Bash, Java, Haskell, R, HTML, C++) I have spent the least time with Javascript which motivated my choice for ExpressJS.

To start the server execute `npm run start` in the root directory.
